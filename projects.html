										<p>This project was conducted in three phases over the course of the semester and was created to facilitate learning computer central processing unit design. The processor had the five basic stages: instruction fetch, instruction memory, instruction execute, data memory, and write-back. A signal cycle and pipelined version were created over the course of the semester. My project was also pushed to the DE-10 Lite FPGA in its final pipelined implementation and worked as designed, computing the MIPS instructions: branch, branch equal/ not equal, immediate instructions, add and subtract, store and load word, and all logical expressions (or, and, xor, etc.). </br>Waveforms were generated and analyzed for correctness in ModelSim. More detail can be provided for this project on request. Final project presentation available <a href="files/MIPSFinalPresentationNathanGardner.pdf">here</a>.</p>

										<h3 class="major">Milestone lab assignements for Embedded System Design</h3>
											<p>This course used an NUCLEO-L452RE STM32 MCU which is part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-M#Cortex-M4">ARM Cortex-M4</a> family. The course used <a href="https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3">libopencm3</a>, which is a lightweight hardware abstraction library available on GitHub and maintained by the open source community. Embedded programming for this course was done in C. Milestones build on top of each other thoughout the semester, each introducing a new topic from the course. Milestones 4-8 were completed in a group of four students. I tried to explain these milestones in a paragraph each, so a lot of technical details had to be brushed over, more detail can be given on any of these milestones. </p>
											<h4>Milestone 1:</h4>
												<p>Getting setup...</p>
											<h4>Milestone 2:</h4>
												<p>Individually completed milestone using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter">UART</a> and ARM Cortex-M4 hardware timers. Wrote system hardware and software initialization code and defined port configurations as well at UART configurations. This program did not use interrupts as requested by the instructions. This program used a gadfly synchronization technique, which periodically checked flags which indicated if UART data was being received. This program was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigenère_cipher">Vigènere cipher</a> programmed to encrypt or decrypt characters sent to the board via the UART port. A supporting circular buffer library was programmed for this milestone. The key for this cipher was “TENNESSEETECH” and a button on the board set the operation mode for encryption or decryption.</p>
											<h4>Milestone 3:</h4>
												<p>Individually completed milestone extending off the previous UART Vigènere cipher functionality but this time with an additional LED.  This program used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">interrupts</a> as requested by the instructions. The extension for this milestone was the ability to set and read the period of the LED in milliseconds. Two commands were created: !!!L and !!!S####, the first of which replaced !!!L and inserted the period of the LED in UART stream sent back from the MCU, and the second of which set the period of the LED in milliseconds, with valid inputs being 0001 to 9999 ms. This required a routine to interface data coming in serially through UART and set the hardware timers based on the commands in real time.</p>
											<h4>Milestone 4:</h4>
												<p>
													This milestone implemented all of the functionality of milestone 3 but his time in a non-preemptive operating system, called <a href="https://github.com/jwbruce/esos32">ESOS</a>, developed by our professor. The OS allowed for multitasking and threading in a lightweight embedded environment and used a concept similar to threads in a traditional operating system, which in ESOS are called tasks. More details on operating system functionality is available in the <a href="http://jwbruce.info/esos32/">ESOS doxygen documentation.</a> </br>
													Code had to be either in hardware/ software initialization or within tasks, and these tasks constantly passed control around in a round-robin fashion. Tasks were created in milestone 4 for receiving UART transmissions, sending UART transmissions, and processing data between the receiving and sending buffers using the vigènere cipher. A circular buffer routine stored the incoming and outgoing character buffers, which were populated by the operating system through the recieve and send tasks.
												</p>
											<h4>Milestone 5:</h4>

											<h4>Milestone 6:</h4>

											<h4>Milestone 7:</h4>

											<h4>Milestone 8:</h4>

										<p>The goal of this assignment is the complete dissection, analysis, and reassembly of a small consumer electronics product. I dissected the La Crosse Indoor Temperature & Humidity Station.</br>The project was designed to simulate the competitive analysis process within engineering as well as test engineering knowledge from throughout many undergraduate courses including: electronics, circuits, any electronics labs, and prior business classes. Analysis was done on many levels including: product history, vendor prices, retail outlets which sell the product, rebranded and OEM versions. A bill of materials was created for the product compiled from bulk electronics sites. </br>Detailed operational analysis was done on the device and CAD circuit diagram was created for the device. A detailed block state diagram for the device was created which covered its operational states.</p>

Praise among critics focused on the game's audio-visuals and gameplay.<br />This is a recreation of the famous video game from the "golden era" of gaming. It was written in VHDL using Quartus for the DE-10 Lite Development board. <br />The DE-10 Lite board from Intel includes a VGA connector and this was used for video output for the gameplay. This is a recreation of the orignal game completed as the final project for digital system design, a course at my university.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock for Introduction to Digital Systems</h3>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/RSPLS/rspls.jpg" alt="" /></span>Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is a spin-off of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors that was popularized by the TV sitcom The Big Bang Theory. RPSLS adds onto Rock Paper Scissors by adding two objects: Lizard (which beats Rock and Paper but loses to Scissors and Spock) and Spock (which defeats Scissors and Rock but is conquered by Paper and Lizard).<br />This game console was designed to simulate a best-of-three RPSLS competition between two players, in which the game will continue until one player has reached a score of two. Each player has five object choice buttons to select from. Each player possesses a “battle” button, and to initiate a “battle” both must simultaneously press their battle buttons along with their selected object choice button. Players are instructed to press only one object choice button at a time. However, if a battle is initiated with a player pressing multiple input buttons at the same time, priority of the inputs is given in the following order from highest to lowest: Spock, Scissors, Rock, Paper, and Lizard. If both players simultaneously press their battle buttons but either of them fails to press an object choice button at that moment, that player’s selection is defaulted to the lowest priority object Lizard.<br />The game console has four outputs: two LEDs and two seven segment displays, both of which have their own finite state machine (FSM). The LED indicates which player has won after each turn and the seven segment represents the score for the current game.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Morse Code Generator for Microcomputer Systems</h3>
										<p>Our final design project for ECE 3130 Microcomputer Systems was a Morse Code Generator, in which a message is input on the keypad by a user, stored, and is later output using the buzzer and LCD in the form of International Morse code.<br />After the user inputs the string, it is set to be read by a function which outputs the users input back to the user in International Morse code, while simultaneously the buzzer outputs noise that represents the dots and dashes audibly for the user. Furthermore, once the program has successfully output the string to the user in Morse code, the program recycles back the point where it will allow the user to input a new message and this cycle will repeat, until the user is satisfied.</p>
