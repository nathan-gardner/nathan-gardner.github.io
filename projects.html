						<h3 class="major">MIPS Architecture 32-bit processor written in VHDL for Fundementals/Computer Design</h3>
						<p>This project was conducted in three phases over the course of the semester and was created to facilitate learning computer central processing unit design. The processor designed had five basic stages: instruction fetch,
							instruction memory, instruction execute, data memory, and write-back. A single cycle and pipelined version were created. The project was also pushed to the DE-10 Lite FPGA in its pipelined implementation and worked as
							designed, computing the MIPS instructions: branch, branch equal/ not equal, immediate instructions, add and subtract, store and load word, and all logical expressions (or, and, xor, etc.). </br>Waveforms were generated and
							analyzed for correctness in ModelSim. More detail can be provided for this project on request. Final project presentation available <a href="files/MIPSFinalPresentationNathanGardner.pdf">here</a>.</p>

						<h3 class="major">Milestone lab assignments for Embedded System Design</h3>
						<p>This course used the NUCLEO-L452RE STM32 MCU which is part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-M#Cortex-M4">ARM Cortex-M4</a> family. The course used <a
								href="https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3">libopencm3</a>, which is a lightweight hardware abstraction library available on GitHub and maintained by the open source community. Embedded programming for this course
							was done in C. Milestones build on top of each other thoughout the semester, each introducing a new topic from the course. Milestone 4 through Milestone 8 were completed in a group of four students. I tried to explain
							these milestones in a paragraph each, so a lot of technical details had to be brushed over, more detail can be given on any of the milestones listed below. </p>
						<h4>Milestone 1:</h4>
						<p>
							Getting environment setup...
						</p>
						<h4>Milestone 2:</h4>
						<p>
							<i>Key concepts: UART and hardware timers</i></br></br>
							Individually completed milestone using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter">UART</a> and ARM Cortex-M4 hardware timers. I wrote system hardware and software initialization
							code and defined I/O port configurations. This program did not use interrupts as requested by the instructions. This program used a gadfly synchronization technique, which periodically checked flags that indicated if UART
							data was being received. This program was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigenère_cipher">Vigènere cipher</a> programmed to encrypt or decrypt characters sent to the board via the UART port. A supporting circular
							buffer library was developed for this milestone to store characters in a buffer. The key for this cipher was “TENNESSEETECH” and a button on the board set the operation mode for either encryption or decryption.
						</p>
						<h4>Milestone 3:</h4>
						<p>
							<i>Key concepts: hardware interrupt implementation with UART commands</i></br></br>
							Individually completed milestone extending off the previous UART Vigènere cipher functionality but this time with an additional LED. This program used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">interrupts</a> as
							requested by the instructions. The extension for this milestone was the ability to set and read the period of the LED in milliseconds. Two commands were created: !!!L and !!!S####, the first of which replaced !!!L and
							inserted the period of the LED in the UART stream sent back from the MCU, and the second of which set the period of the LED in milliseconds, with valid inputs being 0001 to 9999 ms. This required a routine to interface
							data coming in serially through UART and set the hardware timer registers in flight.
						</p>
						<h4>Milestone 4:</h4>
						<p>
							<i>Key concepts: embedded OS introduction</i></br></br>
							This milestone implemented all of the functionality of milestone 3 but his time in a non-preemptive operating system, called <a href="https://github.com/jwbruce/esos32">ESOS</a>, developed by our professor. The OS allowed
							for threading in a lightweight embedded environment and used a concept similar to threads/ tasks in a traditional operating system. More details on operating system functionality is available in the <a
								href="http://jwbruce.info/esos32/">ESOS doxygen documentation.</a> </br>
							System code had either be in hardware/ software initialization or within tasks, and these tasks constantly passed control around in a round-robin fashion. Tasks were created in milestone 4 for receiving UART transmissions,
							sending UART transmissions, and processing data between the receiving and sending circular buffers using the Vigènere cipher. All of the following milestones used ESOS, so I am not going to explicitly state that for each
							milestone description following this one.
						</p>
						<h4>Milestone 5:</h4>
						<p>
							<i>Key concepts: Peripheral Target Board interface</i></br></br>
							This milestone was an extension of milestone 4 but this time interfaced with the EduBase-V2 extension board. The EduBase-V2 board added peripherals around the NUCLEO-L452RE including: numerical keypad, four additional push
							buttons, four seven-segment displays, a buzzer, four additional LEDs, relays, potentiometers, pin headers for I/O, and more. EduBase-V2 board schematic is available <a href="files/BaseBoard_L452.pdf">here</a>. All ports
							had to be defined by the group and read and write functions were written for every needed peripheral I/O port and pin combination on the extension board. </br>
							The additional complexity of this milestone also came from additional software features, which used all five available push buttons to change program operation states between: encrypt, decrypt, command, lower to upper
							case, and the removal of non-alphanumeric characters. Program operation was verified for each operation mode, sending UART characters to the board and receiving the correct UART response through serial communication
							software on a PC. This program implemented the same LED period commands as milestone 4 but his time for each individual LED, all four of which could be queried or set independently through the extension boards 4x4 keypad
							input in the command state. “Sx,nnnn” set LEDx to a period of nnnn milliseconds, and Lx inquired about the period of LEDx in milliseconds. An additional command was implemented for which Rhhhh would return the 16-bit
							representation of the state of the keypad where hhhh was a hex bit-mask for the keypads sixteen individual buttons, represented by a sixteen bit binary value. The keypad for the board was scanned to minimize I/O ports and
							based on the hardware schematic, so a keypad routine was also written for this milestone.
						</p>
						<h4>Milestone 6:</h4>
						<p>
							<i>Key concepts: simple user interface creation within embedded OS</i></br></br>
							This milestone required implementation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_user_interface">simple user interface (SUI)</a>. We were tasked with developing a service that would make it simpler for a
							developer to use and configure I/O. A hardware specific service was created for this milestone which allowed hardware to be abstracted away and simplified interfacing with the boards peripheral devices and I/O. It was also
							a requirement for this lab to implement all of milestone 5 functionalities with the SUI service developed.
						</p>
						<h4>Milestone 7:</h4>
						<p>
							<i>Key concepts: Hitachi LCD character module and service</i></br></br>
							This milestone was an extension of the previous milestone but this time using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi_HD44780_LCD_controller">Hitachi LCD44780</a> included on the EduBase-V2 extension board. ESOS
							has a background service (covered in doxygen linked above) for configuring the LCD, writing characters, and setting the cursor, etc.. This background service was used to interface with the LCD for this milestone. The LCD
							acted as a user interface where the user could see each LCD period in milliseconds and cycle though the four periods with buttons on the keypad. The user could also still set the period with the keypad where D represented
							the edit command, set was represented by the * key, and the numbers pressed filled the LCD from right to left. Another new functionality added was that when the device was encrypting or decrypting using the cipher, the LCD
							screen would be populated with the characters received and sent through UART. The received normal characters were on the top row and the sent encrypted/ decrypted characters were on the bottom row, shifting from left to
							right.
						</p>
						<h4>Milestone 8:</h4>
						<p>
							<i>Key concepts: Seven-segment display service and SPI</i></br></br>
							This milestone used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display">seven-segment displays</a>, a refresh task which took care of updating the multiplexed display, and user API functions, all of which
							combined to create a seven-segment service used to display characters with the seven-segment displays on the EduBase-V2 board. API functions were implemented based on instructions for the following: clear screen, write
							character, write buffer, get display, write string, blink, write u8 decimal, write u8 hex, write i8 decimal, write i8 hex, write u16 decimal, and write u16 hex. The processor’s SPI peripheral was used to interface with the
							seven-segments for this milestone. The board schematic has a SPI master-slave combination connected to the DIG0-3 and QA-QH which were used to write to the seven-segment displays.

						<h3 class="major">Electronic dissection assignment for Embedded System Design</h3>
						<p>The goal of this assignment is the complete dissection, analysis, and reassembly of a small consumer electronics product. I dissected the La Crosse Indoor Temperature & Humidity Station.</br>The project was designed to
							simulate the competitive analysis process within engineering as well as test engineering knowledge from throughout many undergraduate courses including: electronics, circuits, any electronics labs, and prior business
							classes. Analysis was done on many levels including: product history, vendor prices, retail outlets which sell the product, rebranded and OEM versions. A bill of materials was created for the product with prices compiled
							from bulk electronics sites. </br>Detailed operational analysis was done on the device and a CAD circuit diagram was created for the device. A detailed block state diagram for the device was created which covered its
							operational states.</p>

						<h3 class="major">Defender (1981 video game) - VHDL FPGA implementation for Digital Systems Design</h3>
						<p>Original game:</p>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Defender/defender.png" alt="" /></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_(1981_video_game)">Defender</a> is a scrolling shooter video game developed by Williams
							Electronics in 1980 and released for arcades in 1981. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_(1981_video_game)">Defender</a> was one of the most important titles of the golden age of arcade video games, selling
							over 55,000 units to become the company's best-selling game and one of the highest-grossing arcade games ever. Praise among critics focused on the game's audio-visuals and gameplay.<br />This is a recreation of the famous
							video game from the "golden era" of gaming. It was written in VHDL using Quartus for the DE-10 Lite Development board. <br />The DE-10 Lite board from Intel includes a VGA connector and this was used for video output for
							the gameplay. This is a recreation of the orignal game completed as the final project for digital system design, a course at my university.</p>

						<h3 class="major">Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock for Introduction to Digital Systems</h3>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/RSPLS/rspls.jpg" alt="" /></span>Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is a spin-off of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors that was popularized by the TV sitcom The Big Bang Theory.
							RPSLS adds onto Rock Paper Scissors by adding two objects: Lizard (which beats Rock and Paper but loses to Scissors and Spock) and Spock (which defeats Scissors and Rock but is conquered by Paper and Lizard).<br />This
							game console was designed to simulate a best-of-three RPSLS competition between two players, in which the game will continue until one player has reached a score of two. Each player has five object choice buttons to select
							from. Each player possesses a “battle” button, and to initiate a “battle” both must simultaneously press their battle buttons along with their selected object choice button. Players are instructed to press only one object
							choice button at a time. However, if a battle is initiated with a player pressing multiple input buttons at the same time, priority of the inputs is given in the following order from highest to lowest: Spock, Scissors,
							Rock, Paper, and Lizard. If both players simultaneously press their battle buttons but either of them fails to press an object choice button at that moment, that player’s selection is defaulted to the lowest priority
							object Lizard.<br />The game console has four outputs: two LEDs and two seven segment displays, both of which have their own finite state machine (FSM). The LED indicates which player has won after each turn and the seven
							segment represents the score for the current game.</p>

						<h3 class="major">Audio Amplifier Circuit for Electrical Engineering Lab</h3>
						<p>Designed a three stage amplifier circuit with a pre-amp, volume control, and power amplifier. The circuit was designed to use a dynamic microphone as input and drive a 8 ohm speaker to provide a loud voice signal on the
							speaker.<br />The amplifier circuit was designed to have a frequency response between 10 Hz and 7000 Hz as specified in the final project handout.<br />The frequency response was verified in lab and met the specifications
							for the assigned final project. </p>

						<h3 class="major">Morse Code Generator for Microcomputer Systems</h3>
						<p>Our final design project for Microcomputer Systems was a Morse code generator, with which a message is input on the keypad by a user with the devices 16-key keypad, and is later output using the buzzer and LCD in the form
							of International Morse code.<br />The user inputs the string, it is read by a function which outputs the users message back to the user in international Morse code, while the buzzer outputs tones which represent the dots
							and dashes audibly for the user. Once the program has successfully output the string to the user in Morse code, the program recycles back the point where it will allow the user to input a new message and this cycle will
							repeat, forever or until power is removed.</p>
