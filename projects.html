                                        <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Defender/defender.png" alt="" /></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_(1981_video_game)">Defender</a> is a scrolling shooter video game developed by Williams Electronics in 1980 and released for arcades in 1981. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_(1981_video_game)">Defender</a> was one of the most important titles of the golden age of arcade video games, selling over 55,000 units to become the company's best-selling game and one of the highest-grossing arcade games ever. Praise among critics focused on the game's audio-visuals and gameplay.<br />This is a recreation of the famous video game from the "golden era" of gaming. It was written in VHDL using Quartus for the DE-10 Lite Development board. <br />The DE-10 Lite board from Intel includes a VGA connector and this was used for video output for the gameplay. This is a recreation of the orignal game completed as the final project for digital system design, a course at my university.</p>

										<h3>Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock for Introduction to Digital Systems</h3>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/RSPLS/rspls.jpg" alt="" /></span>Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is a spin-off of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors that was popularized by the TV sitcom The Big Bang Theory. RPSLS adds onto Rock Paper Scissors by adding two objects: Lizard (which beats Rock and Paper but loses to Scissors and Spock) and Spock (which defeats Scissors and Rock but is conquered by Paper and Lizard).<br />This game console was designed to simulate a best-of-three RPSLS competition between two players, in which the game will continue until one player has reached a score of two. Each player has five object choice buttons to select from. Each player possesses a “battle” button, and to initiate a “battle” both must simultaneously press their battle buttons along with their selected object choice button. Players are instructed to press only one object choice button at a time. However, if a battle is initiated with a player pressing multiple input buttons at the same time, priority of the inputs is given in the following order from highest to lowest: Spock, Scissors, Rock, Paper, and Lizard. If both players simultaneously press their battle buttons but either of them fails to press an object choice button at that moment, that player’s selection is defaulted to the lowest priority object Lizard.<br />The game console has four outputs: two LEDs and two seven segment displays, both of which have their own finite state machine (FSM). The LED indicates which player has won after each turn and the seven segment represents the score for the current game.</p>

                                        <p>Designed a three stage amplifier circuit with a pre-amp, volume control, and power amplifier. The circuit was designed to use a dynamic microphone as input and drive a 8 ohm speaker to provide a loud voice signal on the speaker.<br />The amplifier circuit was designed to have a frequency response between 10 Hz and 7000 Hz as specified in the final project handout.<br />The frequency response was verified in lab and met the specifications for the assigned final project. </p>

										<h3>Morse Code Generator for Microcomputer Systems</h3>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>Our final design project for ECE 3130 Microcomputer Systems was a Morse Code Generator, in which a message is input on the keypad by a user, stored, and is later output using the buzzer and LCD in the form of International Morse code.<br />After the user inputs the string, it is set to be read by a function which outputs the users input back to the user in International Morse code, while simultaneously the buzzer outputs noise that represents the dots and dashes audibly for the user. Furthermore, once the program has successfully output the string to the user in Morse code, the program recycles back the point where it will allow the user to input a new message and this cycle will repeat, until the user is satisfied.</p>
