### Morse Code Generator for Microcomputer Systems

Our final design project for Microcomputer Systems was a Morse code generator, with which a message is input on the keypad by a user with the devices 16-key keypad, and is later output using the buzzer and LCD in the form of International Morse code.

The user inputs the string, it is read by a function which outputs the users message back to the user in international Morse code, while the buzzer outputs tones which represent the dots and dashes audibly for the user. Once the program has successfully output the string to the user in Morse code, the program recycles back the point where it will allow the user to input a new message and this cycle will repeat, forever or until power is removed.
