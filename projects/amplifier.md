### Audio Amplifier Circuit for Electrical Engineering Lab

Designed a three stage amplifier circuit with a pre-amp, volume control, and power amplifier. The circuit was designed to use a dynamic microphone as input and drive a 8 ohm speaker to provide a loud voice signal on the
speaker.

The amplifier circuit was designed to have a frequency response between 10 Hz and 7000 Hz as specified in the final project handout.

The frequency response was verified in lab and met the specifications
for the assigned final project.
