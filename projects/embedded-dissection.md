### Electronic dissection assignment for Embedded System Design

The goal of this assignment is the complete dissection, analysis, and reassembly of a small consumer electronics product. I dissected the La Crosse Indoor Temperature & Humidity Station.

The project was designed to simulate the competitive analysis process within engineering as well as test engineering knowledge from throughout many undergraduate courses including: electronics, circuits, any electronics labs, and prior business classes. Analysis was done on many levels including: product history, vendor prices, retail outlets which sell the product, rebranded and OEM versions. A bill of materials was created for the product with prices compiled from bulk electronics sites.
        
Detailed operational analysis was done on the device and a CAD circuit diagram was created for the device. A detailed block state diagram for the device was created which covered its operational states.
